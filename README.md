Game developer at Noodlecake Studios. Game jam junkie. Complete and utter tool(er).

I'm a self-taught developer, specialized in C# programming and the Unity game engine. I landed my first professional job within roughly a year of learning via resources like YouTube, game jams, and constant experimentation.
